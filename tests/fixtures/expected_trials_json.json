It is not known whether\n      increasing protein intake in older Americans, whose current intake is below the RDA,\n      increases skeletal muscle mass, muscle performance and physical function.\n\n      Our first aim is to determine whether administration of 1.3 g/kg/day of protein, compared to\n      the RDA (0.8 g/kg/day), will result in greater improvements in lean body mass, maximal\n      voluntary muscle strength and power, and self-reported and performance-based measures of\n      physical function in older men. Our second aim is to determine whether the gains in lean body\n      mass, maximal voluntary strength and self-reported and performance-based measures of physical\n      function during testosterone administration are greater with 1.3 g protein than with the RDA\n      in older men on a eucaloric diet.\n\n      We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using a 2 X 2 factorial\n      design.
